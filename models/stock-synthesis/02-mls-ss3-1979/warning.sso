Note 1 Information: Max data length bin: 330  < max pop len bins: 335; so will accumulate larger pop len bins
Warning 1 : Forecast=0 or -1, so rest of forecast file will not be read and can be omitted;
Warning 2 : A one year forecast using recent F will be done automatically
Warning 3 : Setting in starter does not request all priors, and 5 parameters have priors and are not estimated, so their prior not included in obj_fun.
Warning 4 : Final gradient: 1.46532e-05 is larger than final_conv: 1e-05
Note 2 Information: A revised protocol for the Fcast_yr specification is available and recommended.
Note 3 Information:  N parameters that are on or within 1% of min-max bound: 5; check results, variance may be suspect
