	abstract = {We introduce a length-based, age-structured model, MULTIFAN-CL, that provides an integrated method of estimating catch age composition, growth parameters, mortality rates, recruitment, and other parameters from time series of fishery catch, effort, and length frequency data. The method incorporates Bayesian parameter estimation, estimation of confidence intervals for model parameters, and procedures for hypothesis testing to assist model development. We apply the method to South Pacific albacore, Thunnus alalunga, fishery data and demonstrate the incorporation of model structure such as spatial heterogeneity, age-dependent natural mortality and movement rates, time series trends and seasonal variation in catchability, and density-dependent growth. Consistency of the results of the albacore analysis with various exogenous sets of biological and environmental data gives credence to the model results.},

	abstract = {This study presents the first histology‐based assessment of the reproductive dynamics of south‐west Pacific striped marlin
              Kajikia audax
              . Maturity and reproductive status were assessed from histological sections of ovaries (
              n
              = 234) and testes (
              n
              = 243) of fish caught in commercial longline and recreational fisheries between 2006 and 2009. Spawning peaked in the Coral Sea during November and December at sea surface temperatures between 24·8 and 28·3° C. Lower jaw fork length (
              L
              LJF
              ) at 50\% maturity (
              L
              LJF50
              ), a key variable for stock assessment, was estimated to be 2100 ± 102 mm (mean +
              s.e
              .) for females and 1668 ± 18 mm for males. Unlike large pelagic tunas
              Thunnus
              spp., the proportion of females increased with length and spawning fish formed multiple large‐scale aggregations within a broad latitudinal band. This study provides a starting point for biological parameters needed for stock assessment and conservation of
              K. audax
              and introduces the multiple aggregation spawning concept as a reproductive mechanism to explain genetic heterogeneity observed in some highly migratory species.},
