    "text": "FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one\nwhich fits your needs best.\n\n    The FreeType License (FTL) is the most commonly used one. It is\n    a BSD-style license with a credit clause and thus compatible with\n    the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, but not with the\n    GPL version 2.\n\n    The GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Use it for all\n    projects which use the GPLv2 also, or which need a license\n    compatible to the GPLv2.\n\n\n\n\n                   The FreeType Project LICENSE\n                    ----------------------------\n\n                            2006-Jan-27\n\n                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by\n          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;\n  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,\n  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the\n  FreeType Project.\n\n  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and\n  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\n\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n\n\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\n  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\n  encourage you to use the following text:\n\n   \"\"\"\n    Portions of this software are copyright © &lt;year&gt; The FreeType\n    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.\n   \"\"\"\n\n  Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you\n  actually use.\n\n\nLegal Terms\n===========\n\n0. Definitions\n--------------\n\n  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',\n  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\n  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\n  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,\n  beta or final release.\n\n  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where\n  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source\n  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.\n  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\n  engine'.\n\n  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\n  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and\n  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its\n  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\n  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\n  this license, you must contact us to verify this.\n\n  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,\n  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as\n  specified below.\n\n1. No Warranty\n--------------\n\n  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY\n  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,\n  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR\n  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\n  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO\n  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.\n\n2. Redistribution\n-----------------\n\n  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and\n  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,\n  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and\n  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code\n  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to\n  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted\n  herein, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file\n      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to\n      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying\n      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,\n      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source\n      files.\n\n    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that\n      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the\n      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also\n      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\n      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.\n\n  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\n  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use\n  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid\n  to us.\n\n3. Advertising\n--------------\n\n  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\n  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\n  purposes without specific prior written permission.\n\n  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\n  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\n  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',\n  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\n\n  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\n  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\n  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\n  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\n  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\n  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\n  of this license.\n\n4. Contacts\n-----------\n\n  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:\n\n    o freetype@nongnu.org\n\n      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as\n      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.\n      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you\n      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.\n\n    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org\n\n      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,\n      specific licenses, porting, etc.\n\n  Our home page can be found at\n\n    http://www.freetype.org\n\n\n\n\n            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n               Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.

    "text": "FreeType comes with two licenses from which you can choose the one\nwhich fits your needs best.\n\n    The FreeType License (FTL) is the most commonly used one. It is\n    a BSD-style license with a credit clause and thus compatible with\n    the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3, but not with the\n    GPL version 2.\n\n    The GNU General Public License (GPL), version 2. Use it for all\n    projects which use the GPLv2 also, or which need a license\n    compatible to the GPLv2.\n\n\n\n\n                   The FreeType Project LICENSE\n                    ----------------------------\n\n                            2006-Jan-27\n\n                    Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by\n          David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\n  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;\n  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,\n  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the\n  FreeType Project.\n\n  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and\n  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license\n  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,\n  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.\n\n  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG\n  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion\n  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products\n  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:\n\n    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be\n      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)\n\n    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or\n      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)\n\n    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use\n      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge\n      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the\n      FreeType code. (`credits')\n\n  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this\n  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.\n  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and\n  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.\n\n\n  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a\n  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus\n  encourage you to use the following text:\n\n   \"\"\"\n    Portions of this software are copyright © &lt;year&gt; The FreeType\n    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.\n   \"\"\"\n\n  Please replace &lt;year&gt; with the value from the FreeType version you\n  actually use.\n\n\nLegal Terms\n===========\n\n0. Definitions\n--------------\n\n  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',\n  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally\n  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and\n  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,\n  beta or final release.\n\n  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where\n  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source\n  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.\n  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType\n  engine'.\n\n  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original\n  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and\n  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its\n  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.\n  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by\n  this license, you must contact us to verify this.\n\n  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,\n  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as\n  specified below.\n\n1. No Warranty\n--------------\n\n  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY\n  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,\n  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR\n  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS\n  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO\n  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.\n\n2. Redistribution\n-----------------\n\n  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and\n  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,\n  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and\n  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code\n  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to\n  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted\n  herein, subject to the following conditions:\n\n    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file\n      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to\n      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying\n      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,\n      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source\n      files.\n\n    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that\n      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the\n      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also\n      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your\n      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.\n\n  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on\n  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use\n  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid\n  to us.\n\n3. Advertising\n--------------\n\n  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use\n  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional\n  purposes without specific prior written permission.\n\n  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the\n  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation\n  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',\n  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.\n\n  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to\n  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted\n  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the\n  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.\n  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType\n  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms\n  of this license.\n\n4. Contacts\n-----------\n\n  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:\n\n    o freetype@nongnu.org\n\n      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as\n      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.\n      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you\n      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.\n\n    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org\n\n      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,\n      specific licenses, porting, etc.\n\n  Our home page can be found at\n\n    http://www.freetype.org\n\n\n\n\n            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n               Version 2, June 1991\n\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n     51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n        How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin St, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward.

This   *\n*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *\n*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *\n*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *\n*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *\n*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *\n*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *\n*                                                                      *\n************************************************************************\n\n8.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License.

Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\nLicenses\n\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n-------------------------------------------\n\n  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n  License, v. 2.0.

    "section": "3.1 Pre-meeting",
    "text": "3.1 Pre-meeting\nFollowing SC20 and prior to the modeling meeting, SPC continued development on the stock assessment model to try and improve the fit to the size composition data. These additional investigations focused on how selectivity was defined in the model. In the 2024 stock assessment (Castillo-Jordan et al., 2024), cubic-splines were used to define flexible selectivity curves as a function of age noting that implementation in restricts placement of nodes to age class values. Since the 2024 assessment assumed 10 annual age classes this placed a severe constraint on the shape of the selectivity curve (Figure 1), particularly at the youngest ages when growth was assumed to be quite rapid. A new model mfcl-1979-20p3 (Figure 2) was reparametrized in using quarterly age in order to provide greater resolution in age-specific selectivity at the youngest sizes (Figure 3). The new quarterly age model also included a separate index for each of the four quarters which shared a stationary catchability, and selectivity curve. Additionally, time-varying observation error for each index was not activated and instead assumed a \\(\\sigma = 0.17\\).\nWhile this new model mfcl-1979-20p3 had the desired effect of improving the resolution of selectivity and fits to size composition data, it introduced a new problem into the population dynamics. are not known to spawn year-round like tropical tunas, but rather have a restricted spawning season in the late austral spring and early austral summer where they form multiple discrete spawning aggregations (Kopf et al., 2012). However, in it is difficult to restrict recruitment in a quarterly model to occur in a single quarter of the calendar year. An orthogonal polynomial parametrization for recruitment was applied to restrict recruitment to the first quarter of the calendar year (following spawning in the early austral summer), however the model still introduced recruits into the model in all quarters of the year (Figure 4).",

    "text": "3.2 January 2025 meeting\nModel investigations during the January 2025 stock assessment modeling meeting used the mfcl-1979-20p3 model provided by SPC as a starting point. A table of key model convergence and fit metrics is provided in Table 1.\n\n\n3.2.1 Transition to Stock Synthesis\nDiscussions in the lead up to the January 2025 meeting identified that switching the modeling framework from to Stock Synthesis (Methot & Wetzel, 2013) could help resolve some of the issues identified by SC20 that the mfcl-1979-20p3 model sought to address without compromising key population dynamics assumptions (e.g., annual population dynamics and recruitment). One of the key benefits to is that it can model selectivity as a function of length and/or age. This improves the resolution of the selectivity curve and fit to the size data while maintaining annual population dynamics.\nAn initial model 01-mls-base-1979 was configured to approximate the available mfcl-1979-20p3 model. 01-mls-base-1979 implements a single-sex model spanning 1979-2023 with annual age-structure and quarterly population and fishing dynamics. An early recruitment period from 1969-1978 was used to set-up the initial population age structure, and the initial level of fishing mortality (initF1) was fixed to match the mfcl-1979-20p3. Fishery definitions and selectivity groupings were maintained with selectivity defined as a function of length assuming a double-normal functional form. All length and weight2 composition were reformatted using the bin structure. To initialize the model, the input effective sample sizes for the weight and length composition matched the sum of the input observations from the mfcl-1979-20p3 for each quarterly fishing instance. Rather than use the four quarterly indices, a single quarterly index corresponding to quarter 4 was used in the Stock Synthesis model. Quarter 4 was selected as this was the one most likely to represent changes in the spawning component of the population given the temporal reproductive dynamics described by Kopf et al. (2012). The time-varying observation error specified, but not used, in the mfcl-1979-20p3 model were applied in this case.\nBiological parameters were converted from the mfcl-1979-20p3 model. Growth followed a von Bertalanffy function characterized by explicit parameter values: \\(L_1\\) = 88.38 cm at age 0.25 years, \\(L_2\\) = 210.96 cm at age 10 years, and \\(k\\) = 0.84, with CV structure following a length-at-age pattern. Reproduction dynamics incorporated a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship with steepness fixed at 0.8 and recruitment variance (\\(\\sigma_R\\)) set to 0.2, while the maturity ogive was logistically parameterized with length at 50% maturity at 181.21 cm and a slope parameter of -0.20.\nInitial results from the 01-mls-base-1979 (or 25-mls-base-1979-corrected) models did not show particularly close agreement with the mfcl-1979-20p3 temporal dynamics or spawning biomass scale, however estimates of population numbers were more comparable (Figure 5). However, this model was not expected to show good agreement as it assumed naïve sample sizes for the size composition data and the difference in treatment of observation error for the index. Most importantly, the model ran and could form the basis for further refinements to model structure in order to improve the fit to various data components.\n\n\n3.2.2 Early refinements\nFollowing the successful run of the 01-mls-base-1979 model, a pair of follow-on models were developed in a stepwise manner to address model fit and statistical treatment of data inputs. These modifications resulted in the 02-mls-ss3-1979 and 03-chg-selex-1979 model configurations.\nThe 02-mls-ss3-1979 modifications focused on improving model performance while preserving the fundamental assumptions of the baseline model. Selectivity parameterization was modified through three key adjustments: (1) converting fixed end logit parameters to estimated parameters for fleets using double-normal selectivity; (2) fixing top logit parameters enforce dome-shaped selection where empirically supported; and (3) replacing the New Zealand recreational fishery’s double-normal selectivity with a simpler logistic function. These changes provided greater flexibility in fitting length composition data while maintaining biologically plausible selection patterns. Statistical treatment of composition data was refined by increasing the minimum tail compression value to 1e-02 and implementing fleet-specific effective sample size adjustments (down-weighting factors of 0.03-0.10) to match the level of down-weighting seen in the mfcl-1979-20p3 model. Additionally, the CPUE index error structure was augmented with an observation error component (0.191) derived from loess smoother residual analysis. These modifications collectively addressed potential over-dispersion in composition data and explicitly accounted for potential un-modeled observation error in the standardized index.\nFollowing the implementation of the 02-mls-ss3-1979 model, further adjustments focusing specifically on selectivity were explored in the 03-chg-selex-1979 model. For Fishery 2 (Japanese longline in sub-region 2), Fishery 9 (Australian recreational), Fishery 12 (aggregated longline in sub-region 2), and the standardized abundance index (Fleet 15), the top logit parameters were changed from fixed values to estimated parameters. Concurrently, for these same fleets, the end logit parameters were reverted from estimated parameters to fixed values (-999) to maintain parameter identifiability. This adjustment effectively allowed the peak of the selectivity curve to be estimated while allowing its right-hand tail behavior to decline gradually.\nModifiying selectivity modeling and size composition data weighting in the 02-mls-ss3-1979 model improved the fit to the index (Figure 6) and resulted in somewhat more reasonable selectivity curves. However, issues remained, noticeably for Fleets 2 (Japanese LL; sub-region 2) and 15 (Index). Further tweaking the selectivity in model 03-chg-selex-1979 degraded the fit to the index slightly but resolved some of the existing selectivity issues and generally improved fit to length (Figure 8) and weight (Figure 9) data.\n\n\n3.2.3 Reverting model start year to 1952\nOne of the issues raised at SC20 was the lack of ability of the diagnostic-2024 model to estimate initial conditions in 1979, rather than begin the model at an unfished equilibrium in 1952 as was done in the diagnostic-2019 model. Initial conditions in 1979 in the diagnostic-2024 model were tuned (assuming initial total mortality \\(Z\\) to be \\(1.7 \\times M\\), natural mortality) to match the level of depletion (\\(\\sim 0.35\\)) seen in 1979 from the diagnostic-2019 model. Rationale given for changing the start year to 1979 in the diagnostic-2024 model was to include vessel random effect in the standardized index, and to avoid the issue of implausibly high estimated recruitments in the early years that arose after switching to the updated growth curve.\nFollowing the switch to , a new model beginning in 1952 04-start-1952 was developed from the 03-chg-selex-1979 model to address the initial conditions issue raised with the diagnostic-2024 model, and to see if the alternative selectivity formulation as length-based alleviated the issue of implausibly high estimated recruitments in the early years. The extended model incorporates historical catch data from 1952-1978 extracted from the diagnostic-2019 model. The only size composition data that was included was the New Zealand recreational (Fleet 10) weight composition data. Given that this fishery assumed a logistic selectivity shape, observed declines in average weight could provide information about adult abundance trend and total mortality \\(Z\\) during the years prior to the start of the standardized index. Treatment of the initial condition (e.g., no longer including steepness effects in the initial equilibrium calculations and removal of initF parameter) was also changed to accommodate starting at an unfished condition. Lastly, the recruitment dynamics were reconfigured to accommodate the longer time series. Specifically, the recruitment deviation framework was expanded to span 1952-2021 (recruitment in the last year of the model was not estimated), with early recruitment deviations beginning in 1942 and bias adjustment parameters recalibrated for the extended time series.\nSwitching back to a 1952 start from an unfished condition in the 04-start-1952 model resulted in dynamics that were much similar to the diagnostic-2019 model (Figure 10), especially in terms of more recent estimates of spawning biomass scale and depletion. The change in how recruitment is modeled between and with the use of the early recruitment period and recruitment bias-adjustment ramp eliminates the large spike in recruitment seen in the diagnostic-2019 model and overall recruitment variability in the 04-start-1952 is moderated relative to the two models. Changing to the 04-start-1952 model did degrade fit to the index in later years (Figure 11).\n\n\n3.2.4 Excluding size composition data\nThe next phase of developments considered the effect of removing size composition data from the model that were believed to be unsuitable for use in the model for either data quality, or sampling concerns. Prior to the meeting start, the SPC spent considerable time reviewing the size composition data for each fishery and provided guidance (P. Hamer, pers. comm.) on which data should be excluded. Based on this information, two additional models 05-exclude-bad-comp and 06-exclude-more-comp were sequentially developed from 04-start-1952 to remove un-representative data, minimize data conflicts, and improve the fit to the remaining data (index and size composition). Note that these exclusions were largely exploratory and does not necessarily reflect final decisions on the inclusion/exclusion of data for a proposed 2025 stock assessment model. The cumulative changes leading to the 06-exclude-more-comp are described below.\n\nLength composition changes\n\nFleet 1 (JP LL; sub-region 1): Eliminated all length composition due to small sample sizes and temporal patchiness.\nFleet 2 (JP LL; sub-region 2): Eliminated all length compositions due to conflict with corresponding weight data and temporal patchiness.\nFleet 6 & 7 (AU LL): Excluded all length compositions due to internal conflict with corresponding weight composition data and temporal patchiness relative to more comprehensive weight data.\nFleet 8 (NZ LL): Removed all length compositions based on inadequate sample sizes and temporal patchiness.\nFleet 11 (Aggregate LL; sub-region 1): Targeted removal of 2006-2014 length composition data to exclude TWDW data which may have data quality issues.\nFleet 12 (Aggregate LL; sub-region 2): Eliminated all length compositions. Mixed-flag fishery compositions are spatiotemporally patchy and may fail to representatively capture aggregate fishery dynamics despite potentially having adequate sampling of individual fleet components.\nFleet 13 (Aggregate LL; sub-region 3): Same as for Fleet 12.\nFleet 14 (Aggregate LL; sub-region 4): Removed pre-2006 data that demonstrated anomalously small size observations.\nFleet 15 (Index): Complete removal of length composition due to conflict with weight composition data and evidence of less comprehensive temporal sampling compared to the weight data.\n\n\n\nWeight composition changes\n\nFleet 1 (JP longline; sub-region 1): Removed all weight composition data due to small sample sizes and temporal inconsistencies\nFleet 2 (JP longline; sub-region 2): Specifically removed 1979 weight composition data due to apparent sampling anomalies\nFleet 10 (NZ recreational): Excluded post-1988 weight composition due to management-induced changes in size selectivity (encouraging non-retention of small individuals) that may bias post-1988 samples\n\n\n\nSelectivity changes\nThe selectivity grouping for Fleet 12 was shared with Fleet 2, given the removal of all composition data for Fleet 12 (see Table 2 for updated fishery definitions).\nFits to the index (Figure 12) as well as the remaining composition data (length: Figure 13 and weight: Figure 14) were predictably improved when un-representative and conflicting composition data were removed.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Catch uncertainty\nOne of the concerns raised during development of the diagnostic-2024 model was the influence of large catch event by the Fleet 2 (Japanese LL; sub-region 2) in 1954. This was also a concern in the diagnostic-2019 model, and sensitivity to the starting year was explored in that previous assessment to exclude that large catch observation (Ducharme-Barth et al., 2019). A different approach was taken in the current explorations, and the 07-catch-uncertainty was developed to account for potential uncertainty in the historical catch.\nThe 07-catch-uncertainty model built on the 06-exclude-more-comp model and bifurcated Fleet 2 (Japanese LL; sub-region 2) into two temporal components. This created a distinct fleet (F15_LL.JP.2_early) for pre-1979 data while maintaining the original fleet for more recent observations. Selectivity was shared between the two fleets. However, moving to F_Method = 4 allowed some fleets (Fleets 1 - 14) to stay defined as catch-conditioned, where fishing mortality is calculated to fit the catch exactly, and have Fleet 15 estimate the fishing mortality (F) needed to fit to the catch with observation error. This structural modification also enabled differential parameterization of catch uncertainty, with higher standard errors (SE=0.2) assigned to quarters with higher catch observations (quarters 3-4) and lower uncertainty (SE=0.05) to quarters with lower catch observations (quarters 1-2). Additionally, the catch-conditioned F values for Fleet 15 were used as initial values in the estimation of F. The index fishery stayed the same but became Fleet 16. Parameterizing the model in this way allowed for potential uncertainty in historical catch to be propagated in model estimates in a computationally efficient manner.\nAdding in catch uncertainty (Figure 15) did not greatly change time series estimates of key stock assessment outputs (Figure 16) though it did appear to improve fits to the index (Figure 17).\n\n\n3.2.6 Treatment of growth\nUsing the 07-catch-uncertainty as a baseline, a number of additional models were developed to explore alternative ways of dealing with growth. Growth was a major source of discussion as some of the issues identified in development of the diagnostic-2024 model became more pronounced after switching to a new growth curve provided by Farley et al. (2021), with the new curve showing exceptionally rapid growth through the first year of life. This was flagged as a concern given the opportunistic nature of sampling for the otoliths from longline landed individuals which has reduced selectivity at smaller sizes and would only capture the most rapid growing individuals in the youngest age classes. In an effort to improve model fits and alleviate any potential mis-specification in the growth curve, two classes of models were developed.\nModels 08-relax-growth and 09-relax-growth-v2 attempted to improve the fit by defining variability in growth using CV as a function of length at age, rather than as a standard deviation, and setting the CV for yound and old fish to be 0.15. In the 08-relax-growth model \\(L_1\\) was set to 59.9 cm and assumed an age at \\(L_1\\) of 0, while in the 09-relax-growth-v2 model \\(L_1\\) was set to 88.3822 cm and assumed an age at \\(L_1\\) of 0.25. These models ended up describing functionally identical growth curves, though it was initially unclear from the documentation that this would be the case.\nModels 10-CAAL, 11-CAAL-no-ageerr, 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD, and 13-CAAL-noAgeerr-OGsd all attempted to improve fit by estimating growth internally using the aging data from the Farley et al. (2021) study as conditional age-at-length data. Data were associated with the appropriate fleet definition based on sampling location and flag of vessel sampled from. Though the aging data recorded decimal age, age was entered in the model as the nearest model age less than or equal to the decimal age. Given that model ages were annual, this meant integer age values. For all models \\(L_1\\), \\(L_2\\) and \\(k\\) were freely estimated.\nModels 10-CAAL and 11-CAAL-no-ageerr both defined variability in growth using CV as a function of length at age in the same way as models 08-relax-growth and 09-relax-growth-v2. Model 10-CAAL included an aging error matrix with standard deviations of aging error standard deviation ranging from \\(\\sigma_{Age} = 0.35\\) at age 0 to \\(\\sigma_{Age} = 2\\) at age 10. This was done to account for both actual aging error and for converting from decimal age to integer age to match the model structure.\nModels 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD and 13-CAAL-noAgeerr-OGsd both defined variability in growth using standard deviation as a function of length at age in the same way as model 07-catch-uncertainty, where the standard deviations at the youngest and oldest model ages were \\(\\sim10\\). Model 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD included the same aging error matrix as 10-CAAL while model 13-CAAL-noAgeerr-OGsd did not.\nEstimation of growth internally using conditionaly age-at-length data and size composition slowed growth (lower \\(k\\)) and increased \\(L_2\\) (Figure 18), which had a small effect on recent time-series estimates (Figure 19). It also improved fits to the index (Figure 20), length composition (Figure 21) and weight composition (Figure 22) overall though some fisheries noticeably deteriorated (e.g., the S01_INDEX weight composition data). We note that although the variability in length at age between the formulations using CV vs. standard deviation were approximately the same, the models showed greater stability when variability in growth was defined using a standard deviation as a function of length at age.\n\n\n3.2.7 Additional investigations\nThe 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD model emerged from this process as a reasonable candidate from which a numer of additional investigations were attempted. These are briefly described below.\n\n14-CAAL-target-earlyF: Built off 13-CAAL-noAgeerr-OGsd to implement a targeted approach to historical catch uncertainty by specifically isolating Japanese longline catches from 1954-1978 with values greater than 1 into a separate fleet (Fleet 15) with elevated uncertainty (0.2), while maintaining lower uncertainty (0.01) for all other fleet 2 catches. This refinement built directly upon 13-CAAL-noAgeerr-OGsd but applied a more focused treatment of uncertainty to historical catch. This had negligible impacts on estimated quantities.\n15-CAAL-qtrAge: Attempted to input the conditional age-at-length data as quarterly ages but this was unsuccessful.\n16-CAAL-rm-spike: This model modified 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD to remove the index observation in 1998 to see if attempting to fit this high point was driving the misfit to the index seen in 2000 - 2002. Assessment results with that observation removed showed little meaningful difference with the 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD model results indicating that it is not likely to be the source of the index misfit.\n17-CAAL-noAU-ASPM: This model modified 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD to keep the selectivity values for Fleet 6 (Australian LL; sub-region 2) fixed at the values estimated from model 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD and removed all of the Fleet 6 weight composition data from the likelihood to see if the weight composition data from this fishery was driving the misfit to the index seen in 2000 - 2002. Fit to the index was substantially improved without the inclusion of this data indicating that conflict with this data source is likely the cause of the misfit.\n18-CAAL-cUnc-cv40: Built directly off of 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD to evaluate assessment sensitivity to increased historical catch uncertainty by doubling the standard error values for Fleet 15 (early Japanese longline) from 0.2 to 0.4 (seasons 3-4) and from 0.05 to 0.1 (seasons 1-2). This targeted modification tested the sensitivity of model results to assumptions on historical variability in catch. This had a slight impact to biomass estimates in the early model period showing some sensitivity to this assumption.\n19-CAAL-1979: This model attempted to merge 03-chg-selex-1979 with 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD by begining the model in 1979 with fixed initF, excluding all of the non-representative size composition data, and including the estimation of growth using conditional age-at-length data with an aging error matrix. This model ran but produced biomass estimates that were almost double 03-chg-selex-1979.\n20-CAAL-1979-estInitF: Structurally identical to 19-CAAL-1979 except that initF is estimated. This model was unsuccesful as biomass estimates became unrealistically large.\n21-CAAL-NZrecwtQtr: Built off 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD and re-allocated the New Zealand recreational fishery weight composition data from annual observations in the first quarter of the calendar year to the quarterly periods in which they were observed. This is a more appropriate treatment of the data, but did not result in percievable differences in model estimates.\n22-1979-estInitF-v2: Built off 03-chg-selex-1979 and successfully estimated initF. Time series estimates of recruitment, depletion, and spawning biomass appeared similar to the 2024-diagnostic model.\n23-CAAL-2sex: This model implemented a 2-sex version of the 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD model and estimated sex-specific growth as a proof of concept model. Other biological parameters were assumed to be equivalent between sexes for the sake of this example model. The model ran and produced similar estimates to the single-sex model however with a higher than desired maximum gradient indicating that estimating sex-specific growth internal to the model may be ambitious.\n24-CAAL-Richards: This model implemented a Richards growth model version of the 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD model. Growth was very slightly more rapid with the estimation of a fourth growth parameter but stock status estimates were largely unchanged.\n\nThe key take-aways from these investigations were:\n\nthe misfit to the index seen in 2000 - 2002 is driven by conflict with the Fleet 6 (Australian LL; sub-region 2) weight frequency data which suggests an increasing trend in mean size over the period 1998 - 2002, rather than a decline as seen in the index (Figure 23),\na two sex model is technically feasible though estimation of sex-specific growth parameters may not be (Figure 24 & Figure 25),\ngrowth estimates are slightly sensitive to the functional form used, either von Bertalanffy or Richards (Figure 26),\nre-allocating New Zealand recreational fishing weight composition data to quarters is more correct but doesn’t impact results (Figure 27) and,\nmodel estimates are slightly sensitive to the choice of uncertainty given to the early period catch (Figure 28 & Figure 29).\n\nSingle-sex model development could progress using either 12-CAAL-old-growth-SD or 21-CAAL-NZrecwtQtr as a starting point. Two-sex model development could progress using 23-CAAL-2sex as a starting point noting that may need to be modified to match the quarterly treatment of New Zealand recreational fishery weight composition data used in 21-CAAL-NZrecwtQtr.",

    "text": "4.1 Abundance index construction challenges\nA fundamental constraint in developing a reliable abundance index is the absence of any single fleet that samples consistently across all spatiotemporal strata within the model domain. Historical fishing operations exhibit significant heterogeneity in spatial coverage, with distinct patterns by flag (Figure 30):\n\nJapanese longline vessels initially operated throughout regions 1-3 but have progressively retreated, maintaining operations primarily in region 1 and high-seas pockets of regions 2 and 3.\nTaiwanese longline vessels operate predominantly in regions 1 and 4.\nAustralian longline vessels operate exclusively within their national EEZ in regions 2 and 3.\n\nThis spatial heterogeneity creates a situation where the abundance information provided by any standardized index derives from different spatial strata during different time periods. Without sufficient spatiotemporal overlap between fleets to properly estimate contrasts, systematic biases could be introduced into the abundance trends. This is particularly problematic if localized population dynamics exist, as the varying spatial coverage could potentially detect different segments of the population over time rather than providing a consistent measure of overall abundance.\nFurthermore, this spatial heterogeneity creates potential conflicts between the index and the most informative size composition data, which in recent periods comes primarily from Australian fleets operating in regions 2 and 3. These data-type conflicts could manifest as competing signals in the likelihood function, creating challenges for appropriate model fitting and parameter estimation.\nLastly, the historical period lacks informative covariates, particularly vessel identifiers, prior to 1979 for Japanese vessels that were the primary fleet operating in the region. Without these covariates, there is reduced ability to account for vessel-specific catchability effects in the abundance standardization process.",

Mixed-fishery composition data are particularly problematic due to their spatiotemporally patchy nature (P. Hamer, pers. comm.). Even when individual fleets are representatively sampled, these samples may not accurately characterize the aggregate fishery dynamics, especially when the proportion of catch by different fleets changes over time.\nFor a fast-growing species like striped marlin, variability in composition data can be artificially inflated relative to the true population variability, particularly for younger individuals. This inflation could occur when samples are combined across broad spatial areas within quarterly time steps if underlying migratory patterns exist, which is believed to be the case for this species. Such artificial inflation of variability can lead to model misspecification and consequent poor fits to composition data, potentially biasing key model parameters including selectivity, recruitment, and fishing mortality.",

The sample size is relatively small and derives from opportunistic collection rather than a systematic sampling design, raising questions about how representative these data are of the overall population.\nA particular concern is the potential for sampling bias in younger fish, where samples are likely to represent only the fastest-growing individuals within each age class due to size-selective sampling methods. This sampling bias can lead to significant overestimation of growth parameters, particularly \\(L_1\\) and \\(k\\). Such biases in growth estimation have cascading effects throughout the assessment, potentially affecting estimates of natural mortality, maturity-at-age, selectivity, and ultimately stock status and reference points.

Paradoxically, application of the Francis weighting method would suggest giving this data source even more influence, potentially exacerbating rather than resolving data conflicts. This highlights the need for careful, considered approaches to data-weighting that balance statistical principles with expert judgment about data quality and representativeness.\nIn summary, these technical challenges collectively necessitate careful attention to uncertainty characterization in the assessment results.

    "text": "5.2 Model configuration\n\n5.2.1 Historical period and initial conditions\nThe exploratory models demonstrated that extending the model start year to 1952 (assuming unfished conditions) improved the ability to estimate initial population age-structure, addressing one of the key concerns from SC20. The inclusion of New Zealand recreational weight composition data, particularly from the earlier period, provided useful information on adult abundance trends during the historical period. To properly account for population dynamics throughout the assessment period, it is recommended to:\n\nBegin the model from 1952 assuming unfished initial conditions\nEstimate early recruitment deviations to appropriately configure the initial age structure\nUtilize available historical catch records to inform fishing mortality during the period 1952-1978\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Growth parameterization\nGrowth remains a challenging component of the assessment. If model convergence allows, internal estimation of growth parameters using the conditional age-at-length data is recommended rather than fixing these values based on external information. Specific recommendations include:\n\nTest sensitivity to conditional age-at-length effective sample size weighting schemes\nExplore alternative ageing error assumptions\nIf growth estimation proves problematic, consider a sensitivity analysis with fixed growth parameters\n\nAdditionally, the development of a two-sex model should be explored as a potential sensitivity to better capture sexually dimorphic growth patterns in striped marlin, though this should be considered a lower priority if it complicates model convergence.",

    "section": "5.3 Data components",
    "text": "5.3 Data components\n\n5.3.1 Abundance indices\nThe abundance index is a critical component of the assessment, as fit to the index is prioritized. In order to properly integrate over potential uncertainties in the index, multiple alternative indices should be developed to evaluate sensitivity to different data sources and spatial configurations. A brief justification for each of these alternative indices is also provided.\n\nJapanese longline data only (all regions)\n\nHistorically, Japanese longline fishing had the largest spatial coverage (Figure 30; particularly in sub-regions 1-3) with a high concentration of effort in sub-region 2 during the austral spring and summer which coincides with known perceived striped marlin spawning aggregations (Kopf et al., 2012). Modeling a single flag may alleviate issues that could arise when combining data across flags (e.g., catchability and selectivity differences).\n\nCombined Japanese/Taiwanese/Australian data (all regions)\n\nAs previously mentioned, though the Japanese longling fishery historically had broad spatial coverage no fishery consistently samples across the entire assessment domain or stock spatial distribution. Combining data from the three major fleets will improve spatiotemporal coverage at the risk of violating shared catchability and selectivity assumptions.\n\nAustralian data only (utilizing the existing CSIRO index)\n\nHaving an index and the majority of the weight composition data come from the same fishery may reduce data conflicts within the model. However, if stock dynamics are not well mixed across the model domain this may not representatively index the entire stock.\n\nJapanese data only (restricted to sub-region 2)\n\nA more focused version of the first option to index the spawning component of the population.\n\nCombined Japanese/Australian data (restricted to sub-regions 2 and 3)\n\nA more focused version of the second option to index the spawning component of the population, while augmenting the spatiotemporal coverage of samples.\n\n\nWhen combining data from multiple flags, flag identity should be incorporated as a covariate (fixed effect) in the standardization model. To better understand the sources of variance in the standardized index, particularly the 1998 spike in CPUE, it is recommended to plot nominal CPUE and all predicted quantities (standardized CPUE, encounter rate, positive catch rate) by space and time.\nThe integration of multiple models fitting to different individual indices in an ensemble approach should be considered to better characterize uncertainty in abundance trends. This approach would help address the concern about index-composition data conflicts by explicitly acknowledging potential inconsistencies between data sources.\n\n\n5.3.2 Size composition data\nSelective exclusion of problematic size composition data predictably improved model fit to the remaining data throughout the exploratory phase. The following guidelines should be applied when deciding which composition data to retain:\n\nExclude data from mixed-flag fisheries where sampling is spatiotemporally patchy and there is a severe mismatch between countries providing composition samples and countries taking catch\nRemove Taiwanese length data not measured by observers due to potential quality concerns\nExclude data that shows internal conflict between length and weight compositions from the same fishery (particularly evident in Australian and Japanese data). Only fit to one data type per fishery or selectivity grouping.\nRemove New Zealand recreational weight data following the 1988 policy change encouraging voluntary release of smaller individuals, as this could create a selectivity shift that is difficult to model.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 Data weighting\nThe appropriate statistical treatment of composition data remains challenging for this assessment. The following approaches should be considered:\n\nFrancis weighting may only be reliable for large sample sizes, in any case other assessments (e.g., ISC) only down-weight data based on Francis.\nThe Dirichlet-multinomial approach may be more appropriate for fisheries with small sample sizes\nIf neither approach provides satisfactory results, setting effective sample sizes based on the number of fishing trips rather than the number of individual fish sampled may provide a more realistic weighting scheme",

    "text": "5.5 Further exploration and sensitivities\nSeveral additional model configurations should be explored to fully characterize uncertainty in the assessment and evaluate the robustness of results:\n\n5.5.1 Two-sex model\nDevelopment of a two-sex model structure would provide a more biologically realistic representation of striped marlin population dynamics, particularly given evidence of sexually dimorphic growth patterns. This approach would require: - Further refinement of sex-specific biological assumptions - Careful evaluation of sex-specific selectivity patterns - If two-sex growth estimation remains problematic, implementation with fixed sex-specific growth parameters should be considered\n\n\n5.5.2 1979 model start year\nWhile the 1952 start year is recommended for the base model, a comparative model beginning in 1979 should be developed to evaluate sensitivity to historical assumptions. This model should: - Attempt to estimate initial fishing mortality (initF) rather than fixing it based on external information - Provide a direct comparison with previous assessment configurations - Evaluate whether concerns about implausibly high early recruitments persist with the revised growth and selectivity parameterization\n\n\n5.5.3 Growth parameterization sensitivities\nAdditional targeted sensitivities around growth estimation should be conducted: - Testing alternative weighting schemes for conditional age-at-length data - Exploring different ageing error matrices\nThese explorations will provide information about structural uncertainty in the assessment and help identify parameters or assumptions that exert significant influence on model outcomes.",
