This repository contains model developments for 2025 Southwest Pacific Ocean striped marlin stock assessment conducted during the joint Pacific Community ([SPC](https://fame.spc.int/key-work-areas/stock-assessment)) and [NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/pacific-islands-fisheries-science-center) stock assessment modeling meeting held in Honolulu, Hawai'i from 20-24 January 2025.

A draft meeting [report](https://n-ducharmebarth-noaa.github.io/2025-swpo-mls-meeting/assets/noaa-spc-model-meeting-report.html) is available which will be submit to the 21st Scientific Committee ([SC21](https://meetings.wcpfc.int/meetings/sc21)) of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Committee ([WCPFC](https://www.wcpfc.int/)) as an information paper. Additionally, a summary presentation of the meeting activities to be presented at the SPC Pre-Assessment Workshop (PAW), and a [Shiny application](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/2025-swpo-mls-viewer/) showing outputs of the investigated models are available below.

[Repository instructions](https://n-ducharmebarth-noaa.github.io/2025-swpo-mls-meeting/assets/instructions.html) for working with and running the assessment models are also available.

::: {.callout-note}
Note that models `01-mls-base-1979` through `25-mls-base-1979-corrected` were run during the January 2025 meeting. Models `26-CAAL-maxAge-15` through `64-CAAL-NZdblnormV2-99` were investigated during the April 2025 PAW.
